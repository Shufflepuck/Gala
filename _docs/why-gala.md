Your users are mobile. They use MacBooks and often connect using VPN:

* Their Kerberos ticket is not refreshed
* They are not notified of their password expiration date.
* They have to manually unmount and mount the shares they use the most

Here's how we can help:

* We display how many days are left until AD password expires
* We create and automatically refresh the kerberos tickets, without any intervention from the user
* We automatically mount the shares for the user

What makes us unique:

* We are an international team of MacAdmins
* We believe and support Open Source. Feel free to fork!

Alternatives:

* Apple Enterprise Connect ($5'000 per site)
* [ADmitMac](http://www.thursby.com/products/admitmac) ($179 per seat)
