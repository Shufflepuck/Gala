This site aims to help you get started with Gala. We assume you are a *MacAdmin*; that is: a professional Mac Administrator. 

## So what is Gala, exactly?

Gala is a simple tool to help your Macs:

* Use your Kerberos Single Sign-On (SSO) infrastructure;
* Present friendly Active Directory (AD) password expirations notifications;
* Automatically reconnect to your SMB shares.

It is made for *MacAdmins*, by *MacAdmins*, and available **for free**.
